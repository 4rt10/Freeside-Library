# Freeside-Library
This project aims to organize the library at Freeside, and make checking in and out resources much easier. The database will be able to be hosted on-site or in the cloud, depending on the hardware availability.

### Database
The database will track:

1. Books
	* Title
	* Author
	* Pages
	* ISBN
	* Rating
	* Published Date
2. Publishers
3. Authors
4. Book-Author
	* Stores relationship between books and authors
5. Genres
6. Book-Genres
	* Stores relationship between books and genres


### Functionality
Preferably, we'll use a tablet to act as the front-end for simplicity, but a web interface may be developed for remote lookup or checkout.
